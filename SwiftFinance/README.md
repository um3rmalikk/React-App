# SwiftFinance

SwiftFinance is a lightweight React + Vite starter refactored into a finance dashboard and transaction manager. This repository contains UI skeletons (navbar, sidebar, pages) and simple mock components to get you started building personal or small-business finance tools.

Getting started

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Next steps

- Customize the mock data in `src/components/pages/transactions.jsx` and `src/components/pages/accounts.jsx`.
- Implement authentication/back-end integration for real data.
